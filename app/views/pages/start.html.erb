    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What a design history is</h2>

    <p>A design history is like a blog. It features posts that describe the
    development of new features, iterations of existing ones, or findings from
    user research. It will contain anything that may be useful to return to
    later.</p>

    <p>Over time, a design history becomes a record of your designs. It tells
    the story of what you designed and why.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why you should keep a design history</h2>

    <p>Keeping a design history makes it easy to know why a service is the way
    it is.</p>

    <p>As services age, as theyâ€™re iterated, built and rebuilt, and team
    members come and go, institutional memory fades and questions about why a
    service is the way it is become hard to answer. Context gets lost, research
    disappears, and the design becomes opaque.</p>
