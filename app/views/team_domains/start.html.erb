<p>
  You can set up a shared domain for your team. It will display a page that
  links to your teamâ€™s design histories.
</p>

<p>
  All team pages are publicly accessible. Only your public design histories
  will appear in the list.
</p>

<p>
  Your design histories will continue to be accessible using their own domains.
  If they are set to be private, they will continue to be password protected.
